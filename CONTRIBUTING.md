# Contribution Guideline
Thank you for taking out the time to submit an awesome resource you have created or find that will be useful for the community.

A couple of things to check before you submit the resource.

- It is not already included in the list
- There is no open PRs for the same
- You are submitting high-quality resources only.

If you are submitting a package, then make sure:

- It has a README file or a documentation website.
- The documentation covers the installation and usage details.
- The package does work with the latest version of AdonisJS. If the package does not target the latest version, then it should mention the version it supports.

If you are submitting a learning resource, then make sure:

- The article does achieve what it advertises. **No clickbait allowed**.
- The code samples shown in the article do not have any syntax or logical errors.
- We will not approve - **Top 10 frameworks kind of articles**, or **AdonisJS vs. X**.
